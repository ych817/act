Unit testing is a method used to test individual units or components of a program to ensure that they work as expected. In Python, the unittest module provides a built-in framework for writing and running tests. In the sample code above, the `add(x, y)` function is tested using a test case class TestMathOperations, which inherits from unittest.TestCase. The test_add method checks if the add function returns the correct output for given inputs. This ensures that changes to the function later won't break its expected behavior. Unit tests help catch bugs early and improve code reliability.


```
import unittest

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
